A total beginner tried to rule the crypto world, but then chickened out, so ...:

- Crawled price data of a specific coin from Binance's web
- Generated buy/sell signal with Bollinger Band Algorithm
- Picked which signal to buy/sell to minimize loss in the most simple way
- Plotted price and backtesting result (investment change along timeline)
- Calculated final profit

In testing site, we can automatically place order to buy/sell with fake data, it's no hard, but I choose to make simulated order with real data from real site to check if my algorithm really works
